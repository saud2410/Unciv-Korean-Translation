 # 바빌론

May the gods bless you, great Nebuchadnezzar, ruler of ancient Babylon!
고대 바빌론의 통치자, 위대한 네부카드네자르여, 신들의 축복이 있기를!

Built 5000 years ago,
바빌론은 5천년 전에 건설되었고,

Babylon emerged as an empire in 1800 BC, thanks to godlike Hammurabi, The Giver of Law.
기원전 1800년에는 법전을 만드신 신성한 함무라비 왕의 은덕으로 제국으로 부상했습니다.

Falling under the Kassites assaults then the Assyrian domination, Babylon was reborn from its ashes, gaining back its independance,
비록 카시트인에게 짓밟히고 아시리아인의 지배를 겪었지만, 바빌론은 잿더미에서 독립하여 고대 세계에서 예술과 학문의 봉화로 재탄생했습니다.

and became the beacon for Arts and Learning in the ancient world.


O Nebuchadnezzar, after your death, Babylon quickly fell, conquered by the mighty Persians, and then by the Greeks, until the great city disappeared forever in 141 BC.
네부카드네자르여, 그대가 세상을 떠난 후 바빌론은 빠르게 쇠락하여 강대한 페르시아와 그리스에 정복당하고, 기원전 141년에는 위대한 바빌론 시 자체가 사라졌습니다.

Great Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon's glory still lives through you and your people.
위대한 네부카드네자르여, 바빌론의 영광은 여전히 그대와 백성들 안에 살아있습니다.

세계를 다시금 깨우칠 빛으로서, 그대의 제국이 세월 속에서 빛나게 하시겠습니까?

Great King Alexander, leader of the mighty Greek nation, you are truly blessed by the gods.


In 480 BC, quarrelsome city-states such as Athens, Sparta, Thebes, found a way to join their forces, allowing Greece to defeat the mighty Persia in the 5th century BC, both on land and sea.


Following their example, you lead a Greek coalition and finally struck down the Persian Empire in 331 BC.


You conquered almost all the known world, and from Europe to Africa to India, you built an empire unmatched by any before it.


Megalexandros, son of Zeus, will you ride Bucephalas again, to gift the world with the brightness of the Greek culture?

Great Queen, can you make China prevail again, using your divine intelligence and beauty?

Vive Napoleon I, First Consul and Emperor of France!


After the glorious Revolution which suppressed the centuries-old monarchy, the French nation stood at the heart of Europe as a Republic, and intended to export its ideals to the entire European continent, either by diplomacy or war.


The French Capital Paris was more than ever the world center of Culture, Arts, and Letters.


With its Great Army, reputed as one of the greatest in the History, France fought gloriously all surrounding enemies, but eventually fell against the coalition of other European powers.


Napoleon Bonaparte, ruler of the French people, will you rebuild the Empire to take revenge on your foes, and make again of its Capital the City of Lights?

The Roman people crafted so brilliantly its culture, law, art, and warfare, that no one could contest the supremacy of Rome.


Force and Honor led to glorious conquests, a domination of all the lands from Spain in the west to Syria in the east, even reaching the remote barbarian lands of England and Germany.


Roman art and architecture have been praised for millenia and have been envied by all lesser civilizations who have followed.

Blessings of the Great God be upon you, O great caliph Harun al-Rashid, leader of the mighty Arabian people!


The Muslim Empire, the Caliphate, born from chaos after the death of the prophet Muhammad in 632 AD, intended to apply the rule of God to all Earth.


And by the will of God, the caliphate reached its full power, ruling Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Anatolia, the Balkans and Persia, to even surpass the Great Roman Empire.


The arts and sciences were a holy gift of Arabia during the Middle Ages, as the infidel lands of Europe delved deep into ignorance and chaos.


Lasting for six hundred years, the Caliphate finally fell before the Mongols, the plague of the civilized world.


Great Caliph Harun al Rashid, all Arabian people long for greatness!


Arabia must be once again the land of arts and knowledge, which under the radiant law of God, will fear no enemy!

At the height of its power, triumphant after two terrible world wars, United States of America, a land of immigration, opportunities, optimism and determination, has risen above all other weakening nations, unable to equal such power.

 # 인도

Wise Mahatma Gandhi, great leader of India, we honor you!


India is one of the oldest countries in the world with 10,000 years of history, built on spirit and religion, as three of the world's great religions - Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism - appeared on this sacred land.


Every aspect of India society reveres art, music and color, showing great wealth but also grinding poverty.


For centuries, India was torn between local kingdoms fighting each other but also repelling invaders.


In the 12th century AD, Muslim Turks tried to conquer India, then the Mongols took their place.


In the early 17th century, India, still fragmented, was colonized by the English and their diplomacy and technological superiority.


After two centuries of British dominion, Indian nationalism woke up, and you, Great Mahatma, have led a peaceful and victorious rebellion never seen anywhere in history!


Gandhi, your people ask again to be led on the path of freedom.


Under protection of Ganesha and Surya, can India accomplish its great potential?

 # 독일

All hail to Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of Germany and its empire!


During the ancient era, Germany was a land fragmented in several tribes but already showed great promise as the Roman Empire itself struggled to bend the Germans to its will.


Germany, as one nation, was slowly built on the ruins of the Holy Roman Empire, and waited 1871 to be finally unified after the glorious victory on France and Napoleon III.


The German people are creative, intelligent, industrious and proven to be talented warriors through history.


Despite great catastrophes and failures in the first half of the 20th century, Germany can always rely on its people will and strength to be among the greatest and powerful nations in the world.


Great Prince Bismarck, glory and power are at the heart of the German nation.


Your people are bright, and lend you their iron will to lead Germany once again.

O Great Sultan Suleiman, may the God bless you!

The Ottoman Empire was born in Bithynia, starting as a small country in Eastern Anatolia in 12th century, then expanded to west into Anatolia.


Over the next century, your people vanquished the empire of Byzantium, annexing Turkey and the Balkans, and smartly assimilating all wonders and knowledge of the Byzantine civilization.


In the mid 15th century, the Ottomans added Constantinople to their empire, establishing a strategic link between Europe and the Middle East.


The Empire would continue to expand for centuries reaching North Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe at its height, but brutally disappeared in the chaos of the first world war, in early 20th century.


Mighty Caliph, your people ask you to build again the Empire, to the level of power and glory it once achieved, and beyond!


Will you revive the Ottoman golden age?

Your people lived near the great and holy lake Ontario since the ancient ages, on a land that will be later known as New York city.


Long ago, the five peoples of Seneca, Onondaga, Mohawks, Cayugas and Oneida became one nation, the Haudenosaunee, the Iroquois.


Although not having a written language, the wise Iroquois created the Great Law of Peace, which can be considered the first established constitution.


For decades, your people fought powerful enemies, such as the Huron, and then the French and English colonists.


With less warriors and inferior weaponry, the Iroquois still survived and walk on the path of peace and harmony, until their way of living faded away under the crush of the newborn United States nation.


Great Sachem Hiawatha, do you hear the complaints of your people?

Cunning diplomacy and military achievements helped then to conquer the wealthy Lydia and the powerful Babylon, Cyrus' son conquering the eternal Egypt some years later.


At the height of its power, the Persian Empire reached the shores of Macedonia, at the very door of the upstart Greek city-states.


Persia would have prospered for centuries if Alexander of Macedon hadn't brutally destroyed the great empire in one violent strike.

Siam was a part of the Khmer Empire until the 13th century AD, before its brave people took arms and led a revolution to form the small Sukhothai kingdom.


After many battles and diplomacy prowess, this tiny kingdom became a mighty empire, which would dominate South East Asia for more than a century.

Wars were frequent with other tribes to control the rich land surrounding the sacred lakes of Texcoco, Xaltocan and Zampango.


In some 200 years, double-sided alliances and martial prowess made of the Aztecs the dominant power in the Central American basin, forming a mighty empire stretching from sea to sea.


Alas, the empire fell under the assault of foreign devils - the Spaniards and many curses they brought with them!


Wars between tribes and weaponry of doom used by the invaders made the great Aztec civilization crumble in only a few decades.
